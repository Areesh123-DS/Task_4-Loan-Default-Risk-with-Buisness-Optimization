# Task_4-Loan-Default-Risk-with-Buisness-Optimization
## Dataset: 
- application_train.csv taken from kaggle

## 🎯 Objective

Predict whether a loan applicant will default and optimize lending decisions using profit-driven thresholds.

## ⚙️ Approach

- Used the Household Loan dataset to train classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest. 
- Data preprocessing included handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling.
- Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- A business-focused optimization layer was applied to simulate profit/loss outcomes and tune decision thresholds accordingly.

## 💡Results and Insights

- Profit-based threshold tuning helped reduce default risk while maximizing financial returns.
- The project successfully integrated machine learning with business logic for smarter loan approval decisions.
